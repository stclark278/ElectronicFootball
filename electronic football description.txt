Electronic Football

My final project is a recreation of the 1978 handheld "Electronic Football" game from Mattel.  In this game the goal is to get your player
past the defenders and into the endzone to score 7 points.  If you get the ball over the 50 yard line and use the kick function you can
also score 3 points for a field goal.  There are two difficulty settings that change the speed of play as well as an option for 1 or 2
players.

Using the AWSD keys you can move your player towards your endzone.  After a player scores or punts the next player takes control or the
computer rolls to see if the computer scores.  After the player is tackled when the clock has reached zero the game is over and the winner
is determined.  While the original AI was likely different than the AI I implemented for the defenders, I didn't want to directly copy
the already made product.

This was one of the coolest handheld video games made before the advent of handhelds like the gameboy or the gamegear.
Even though the game had a very simplistic graphic design, requiring the player to move a light across the screen to avoid other lights,
this game had a more in depth gameplay experience than some of the home video games at the time.  The simplistic gameplay of the Tiger
electronic handhelds really held them back in the replayability of their games even though they had better "graphics" than the Mattel
Electronic Football game.
